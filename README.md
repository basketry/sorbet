# Sorbet

[Basketry generator](https://github.com/basketry/basketry) for generating [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) interfaces. This parser can be coupled with any Basketry parser.

## Quick Start

The following example converts a "Swagger" doc into [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) types:

1. Save `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` as `petstore.json` in the root of your project.
1. Install packages: `npm install -g basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/sorbet`
1. Generate code: `basketry --source petstore.json --parser @basketry/swagger-2 --generators @basketry/sorbet --output src`

When the last step is run, basketry will parse the source file (`petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator (in this case only `@basketry/sorbet`) writing the output folder (`src`).

## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
